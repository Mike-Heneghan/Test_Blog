          <h3>Growing Up</h3>
          <p class="description">

          <h3>University Years</h3>
          <p class="description">
            After completing Secondary School I moved to Aberdeen to undertake a fast track masters in Mechanical and Offshore Engineering at the Robert Gordon University. It was here I had the opportunity to meet lots of new people and cultivate hobbies and interests. In particular the indoor climbing wall and snowsports dry slope.

          <h3>Professional Life</h3>
          <p class="description">After completing my studies I joined Schluberger Oilfield Services as a Completions Field Engineer. In this role I installed high accuracy downhole pressure/temrperature sensors in Oil and Gas Wells. I enjoyed the excitement of working in diverse places such as the North Sea and Malayasia as well as the training schools in Paris and Abu Dhabi. I also had thedubous honour of being featured in  <a href="https://petroglobalnews.com/2015/12/schlumberger-warns-of-new-layoff-round/" target="_blank">Petro Global News</a> with a photo used from a brochure.

            <h3>Snowboarding</h3>
            <p class="description"> After taking the opportunity to undertake snowboarding lessons through the RGU snowsports club I have had the opportunity to go on many trips. I've spent a lot of weekends at Glenshee and the Lecht as well as France and even a trip to Niseko in Japan.

            <h3>Hillwalking</h3>
            <p class="description">One of my favourite weekend past times is making the most of the Scottish country side by going hillwalking. I'm slowly making my way through all 283 Munroes and hope to have walked over 50 of them by the end of the year.

            <h3>Indoor Climbing</h3>
            <p class="description">Indoor climbing has become a particularly rewarding past time for me. In the last year I've become increasingly hooked on trying new routes and moves. I'm hoping to continue improving and try outdoor climbing in the summer.

        <h3>Adopt Greyhounds</h3>
        <p class="description">I've always wanted to have a pet dog but due to family members having allergies and living in temporary accommodation I've never been able to have a dog. I'm excited to get the opportunity to adopt rescue greyhounds to give them a good home where they may otherwise be put down and due to their kind and gentle nature.

        <h3>Join the Tech Industry</h3>
        <p class="description">From a young age I've been interested in technology. This has manifested itself in my interests in Science-Fiction and Engineering as well as attempting to keep up to date with new technologies. I would like to work in a company and role that make mne feel part of tech movement and contributing to human progress. Developments in augmented reality, 3D printing, quantum computing and machine learning will shape the future.
        To help my Dad learn how to use a 3D Printer I modelled and printed a grehound. After positng it on reddit I uploaded the design to the Thingiverse allowing anyone to download and print it for free themselves.
